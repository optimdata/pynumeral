Welcome to pynumeral's documentation!
=====================================

``pynumeral`` is a python implementation of number formatting using `numeraljs format`_. This project was motivated when we had to render numbers backend-side (which is written in python) while keep using formats defined by users. It has been coded regardless of the javascript implementation. It has been tested on a fairly large amount of formats but there are not any guarantees that it covers all the cases. Since unit testing is pretty simple, contributions are more than welcome.
